abstract = {The paper presents a new optimization algorithm, which adapts the behavior of honey bees during their search for nectar. In addition to the established ant algorithms, bee-inspired algorithms represent a relatively young form of solution procedures, whose applicability to the solution of complex optimization problems has already been shown.The herein presented two-stage approach belongs to the class of metaheuristics to control a construction heuristic and has been applied successfully to the NP-hard Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW).Within the paper, evaluation results are presented, which compare the developed algorithm to some of the most successful procedures for the solution of benchmark problems. The pursued approach gives the best results so far for a metaheuristic to control a construction heuristic.},

abstract = {While John Holland has always envisioned learning classifier systems (LCSs) as cognitive systems, most work on LCSs has focused on classification, datamining, and function approximation. In this paper, we show that the XCSF classifier system can be very suitably modified to control a robot system with redundant degrees of freedom, such as a robot arm. Inspired by recent research insights that suggest that sensorimotor codes are nearly ubiquitous in the brain and an essential ingredient for cognition in general, the XCSF system is modified to learn classifiers that encode piecewise linear sensorimotor structures, which are conditioned on prediction-relevant contextual input. In the investigated robot arm problem, we show that XCSF partitions the (contextual) posture space of the arm in such a way that accurate hand movements can be predicted given particular motor commands. Furthermore, we show that the inversion of the sensorimotor predictive structures enables accurate goal-directed closed-loop control of arm reaching movements. Besides the robot arm application, we also investigate performance of the modified XCSF system on a set of artificial functions. All results point out that XCSF is a useful tool to evolve problem space partitions that are maximally effective for the encoding of sensorimotor dependencies. A final discussion elaborates on the relation of the taken approach to actual brain structures and cognitive psychology theories of learning and behavior.},

abstract = {Feature selection is the process of finding the set of inputs to a machine learning algorithm that will yield the best performance. Developing a way to solve this problem automatically would make current machine learning methods much more useful. Previous efforts to automate feature selection rely on expensive meta-learning or are applicable only when labeled training data is available. This paper presents a novel method called FS-NEAT which extends the NEAT neuroevolution method to automatically determine an appropriate set of inputs for the networks it evolves. By learning the network's inputs, topology, and weights simultaneously, FS-NEAT addresses the feature selection problem without relying on meta-learning or labeled data. Initial experiments in an autonomous car racing simulation demonstrate that FS-NEAT can learn better and faster than regular NEAT. In addition, the networks it evolves are smaller and require fewer inputs. Furthermore, FS-NEAT's performance remains robust even as the feature selection task it faces is made increasingly difficult.},

abstract="To date there have been few implementation of Holland's Learning Classifier System (LCS) on real robots. The paper introduces a Temporal Classifier System (TCS), an LCS derived from Wilson's ZCS. Traditional LCS have the ability to generalise over the state action-space of a reinforcement learning problem using evolutionary techniques. In TCS this generalisation ability can also be used to determine the state divisions in the state space considered by the LCS. TCS also implements components from Semi-Mark- Decision Process (SMDP) theory to weight the influence of time on the reward functions of the LCS. A simple light-seeking task on a real robot platform using TCS is presented which demonstrates desirable adaptive characteristics for the use of LCS on real robots.",

In this paper we show why off-policy RL methods combined with linear function approximators can lead to divergence. Furthermore, we analyze two different types of updates; standard and averaging RL updates. Although averaging RL will not diverge, we show that they can converge to wrong value functions. In our experiments we compare standard to averaging value iteration (VI) with CMACs and the results show that for small values of the discount factor averaging VI works better, whereas for large values of the discount factor standard VI performs better, although it does not always converge.",
